# TCP/IP Layers

From low-level to high-level:

1. __Physical layer__: contains all the functions needed to carry the bit stream over a physical medium to another system.
2. __Data Link layer__: organizes the bit stream into a data unit called a "_frame_" and delivers the frame to an adjacent system.
3. __Network layer__: delivers data in the form of a _packet_ from source to destination, across as many links as necessary, to non-adjacent systems.
4. __Transport layer__: concerned with process-to-process delivery of information.
5. __Application layer__: concerned with differences in internal representation, user interfaces, and anything else that the user required.
