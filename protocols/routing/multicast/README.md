# Multicast

The one-to-many operation of multicast is a technique between the one-to-one packet delivery operation of unicast and the one-to-all operation of broadcast.

Multicast protocols are still not universally supported on the Internet. Sometimes similar functionalities are acomplished with numerous unicast links, each running from the server to every individual host.

Many-to-many multicast applications, such as on-line gaming and gambling sites, use multiple point-to-point meshes of links in most cases. Multicast uses the routers to replicate packets instead of the servers.

The key component of the multicast network is the multicast-capable router, which replicates the packets, they use a _multicast routing protocol_ to build a _distribution tree_ to connect receivers to sources.
