# HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
 
Application protocol for distributed, collaorative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access.

HTTP functions as a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model. Client submits an HTTP request message to the server, which provides resources such as HTML files and other content, or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a response message to the client.

This protocol is designed to permit intermediate network elements to improve or enable communications between clients and servers. High-traffic websites often benefit from web cache servers that deliver content on behalf of upstream servers to improve response time. Web brosers cache previously accessed web resources and reuse them, when possible, to reduce network traffic.

HTTP presumes an underlying and reliable transport laer protocol, TCP is commonly used, however it can be adapted to use unreliable protocols such as UDP.

Also, HTTP resources are identified and located on the network by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), using the Uniform Resource Identifier (URIs) schemes http and https.
