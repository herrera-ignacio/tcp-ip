# MPLS: Multiprotocol Label Switching

Routing technique in telecommunications networks that directs data from one node to the next based on short path labels rather than long network addresses, thus avoiding complex lookups in a routing table and speeding traffic flows.

Labels identify virtual links (paths) between distant nodes rather than endpoints.

MPLS can encapsulate packets of various network protocols, and supports a range of access technologies, including T1/E1, ATM, Frame Relay, and DSL.
