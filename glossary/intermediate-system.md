# Intermediate system

Hosts that do not communicate directly, rather pass information through one or more intermediate system.

Often generically called "network nodes" or just "_nodes_".

Specific devices are labeled "routers", "bridges", or "switches", depending on their precise roles in the network.

## Devices

On the Internet, the intermediate systems that act at the __packet level__ (Network layer) are called _routers_, the ones that act on __frames level__ (Data Link layer) are called _switches_, and some older telephone-based WAN architectures use switches as intermediate network nodes.
