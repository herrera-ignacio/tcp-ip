# Ethernet

## Origins

The original Ethernet was developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in the mid-1970s to link the various mainframes and minicomputers that Xerox used in their office park campus environment of close-proximity buildings.

Their solution was to invent the local area network, the LAN. However, Xerox was not interested in actually building hardware and chipsets for their new invention, which was named Ethernet. Instead, Bob Metcalf, the Ethernet inven- tor, left Xerox and recruited two other companies, one to make chipsets for Ethernet and the other to make the hardware components to employ these chip- sets. The two companies were chip-maker Intel and computer-maker Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Ethernet v1.0 was rolled out in 1980, followed by Ethernet v2.0 in 1982.

Eventually, all of these technolo- gies except those on coaxial cable went first to 100 Mbps (100BaseT), then 1000 Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet), which run over twisted pair for short spans and can use fiber for increasingly long hauls, now in the SONET/SDH ranges. Today, IEEE 802.3ae 10G-base-er (extended range) LAN physical layer links can span 40 km. Another, “zr,” can stretch the span to 80 km. And interestingly, 10-Gbps Ethernet is back on coaxial cable as “10 Gbps cx4.”. New work is always pushing the speeds higher.

## Ethernet II and IEEE 802.3 Frames

Today, of course, the term “Ethernet” essentially means the same as “IEEE 802.3 LAN.” In addition to changing the hardware component names and creating IEEE 802.3 10BaseT, the IEEE also changed the Ethernet frame structure.
