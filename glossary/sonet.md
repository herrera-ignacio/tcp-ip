# Sonet

SONET is the North American version of the international SDH standard and defines a hierarchy of fast transports delivered on fiber-optic cable. One of the most exciting aspects of SONET when it first appeared around 1990 was the ability to deploy SONET links in self-healing rings, which nearly made outages a thing of the past.
