# VPN: Virtual Private Network

A VPN is a private communications network most often used within a single organization to communicate over a public network. VPN traffic is carried over a public network infrastructure, such as the Internet, using standard and unsecure protocols.

However, the VPN mechanisms make the network look and feel like a private network composed of network nodes owned and operated by the organization and the leased lines connecting them, which carry the organization's traffic only.

## Security and VPNs

VPNs do not have to be secure at all.

Secure VPNs use encrypted tunneling protocols to add confidentiality, user and resource authentication, and message integrity to achieve the levels of security and privacy desired/affordable.

## VPNs and Protocols

VPNs do not rely on one protocol or another for everything.
