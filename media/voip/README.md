# VoIP: Voice over Internet Protocol

VoIP also called IP telephony, is a method and group of technologies for the __delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over IP networks__, such as the Internet.

## Overview

Steps and principles involved in originating VoIP telephone calls are similar to traditional digital telephony and involve signaling, channel setup, digitization of the analog voice signals, and encoding.

Instead of being transmitted over a circuit-switchet network, the digitial information is packetized and transmission occurs as IP packets over a packet-switched network. They transport media streams using special media delivery protocols that encoude audio and video with audio codecs and video codecs. Various codecs exist that optimize the media stream based on application requirements and network bandwith.
