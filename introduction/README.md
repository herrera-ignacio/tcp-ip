# Protocls and Layers

## Introduction

I'll use TCP/IP as shorthand for the entire _Internet Protocol Stack_, but you should always be aware that the suite consists of many protocols, not just TCP and IP, which are constantly growing and evolving as the Internet adapts to new challenges and applications.

In the past few years, five trends have become clear in the protocol evolution:

### Trends

#### 1. Increased use of multimedia

Original Internet was not designed with proper quality of service assurances to support digital voice and video.

#### 2. Increased bandwith and mobility

Trend is toward higher bandwith (capacity). New wireless technologies seem to promise the "Internet everywhere".

#### 3. Security

Attacks have become much more sophisticated. Privacy tools such as encryption and digital signatures are no longer an option but a necessity. E-commerce is bigger and bigger every year, on-line banking, stock transactions, and other financial manipulations make strong security technologies essential.

#### 4. New Protocols

Protocols age and become obsolete. IPv6, the eventual successor for IPv4, is showing up on networks around the world, especially in applications where the supply of IPv4 addresses is inadequate (such as cellphones).

#### 5. Increased virtualization

Rise of cloud computing, large data centers, the need for more flexible networks, and the pace of hardware evolution have combined to make three things very important:

* Cloud computing
* Software defined networks (SDNs)
* Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)
